### 📋 Brief

The goal of this project is to teach you how to structure a website using HTML i.e. different sections of a website like header, footer, navigation, main content, sidebars etc. Do not style the website, only focus on the structure. Styling will be done in separate projects.

In this project, you are required to create a simple HTML-only website with multiple pages. The website should have the following pages:

- Homepage
- Projects
- Articles
- Contact

The website should have a navigation bar that should be present on all pages and link to all the pages.

You are not required to style the website; you are only required to create the structure of the website using HTML. The goals of this project are:

- Learn how to create multiple pages on a website.
- Structure a website semantically using HTML.
- Structure in a way that you can easily add styles later.
- Add SEO meta tags to the website.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: per la struttura. È la prima volta che uso html semantico
- **CSS3**: solo inline dato che la richiesta insiste sul non doverlo usare per forza. Flexbox per organizzare il layout
